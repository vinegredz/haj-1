        <h1 class="mb-4">When the System Fails Them, We Help the Jews</h1>
        <p><em>Help a Jew – Help the Holy Land</em> is run by a group of legal professionals who specialize in the laws
            of Israeli
            repatriation. Anatoly Gakenberg and Eli Gervits have helped hundreds of former Soviet Jews exercise their
            legal and God-given rights to return home to Israel.</p>
        <p>We have seen the system fail many Post-Soviet Jews and shatter their dreams of making repatriation. We
            started <em>Help a Jew – Help the Holy Land</em> to join forces and advance the coming of our shared destiny
            of the
            ingathering of the exiles and the end of injustice.
        </p>
        <p>Our programs aim to help individuals on a case-by-case basis and ultimately, bring lasting change to the
            system.</p>

                <div class="px-md-5">

                    <p>Anatoly Gakenberg was born in Russia. He graduated from Yaroslavl State University with LLB in
                        1996
                        and repatriated to Israel in the same year.</p>
                    <p>Three years later, he became a licensed Israeli attorney and started a law firm. Since he spoke
                        Russian, the majority of Anatoly's clients were Russian Jews, recent immigrants from the former
                        Soviet Union.</p>
                    <p>In 2006, Anatoly started his second law degree at the University of Kansas School of Law. After
                        graduating with a JD degree he was offered a senior position with major US law firm in Moscow
                        where
                        he dealt with multi-million dollar acquisitions.</p>
                    <p>A few years after he realized that his true calling wasn't in corporate law, but in helping real
                        people fight for justice.</p>
                    <p>Anatoly moved to London in 2010 where he focused on assisting claims by Russian high net
                        worth
                        individuals relocating to the UK.</p>
                    <p>Throughout his legal career, Anatoly always stayed attuned to the needs of Russian Jews fighting
                        for
                        their way out of Russia to Israel and represented dozens of such clients.</p>
                    <p>Anatoly established this charity so that he could make lasting change in clearing the hurdles
                        that
                        Russian Jews face on their way to come home to Israel like he once had, himself.</p>
                    <p>Anatoly is married and has a son, David, named after King David. He's a licensed attorney in
                        Russia,
                        Israel, Massachusetts, and England and Wales.</p>
